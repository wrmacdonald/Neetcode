# Basic Concepts - Cracking the Coding Interview

# 1️⃣ --- Data Structures ---
# Hash Tables
    # Maps Key: Value 
    # Efficient lookup: ~ O(1)
# Vectors/ArrayLists 
    # dynamically resizing list
    # Amortized lookup: ~ O(1)
# Linked Lists
# Trees, Tries, & Graphs
# Stacks & Queues
# Heaps

# 2️⃣ --- Algorithms ---
# Breadth-First Search
# Depth-First Search
# Binary Search
# Bubble Sort:  
    # Sort & simple, but slow 
    # Time Ave: O(n), Space: O(1)
    # Iterate through n^2 times, bubbling up largest elem to the end, end-1..., each time
# Merge Sort:
    # Divide & Conquer Algo
    # Time (B,W,A): O(n*log n), Space: O(n)
    # keep spliting arr in half, then combine back together 2 sorted arrs in sorted order
# Quick Sort


# 3️⃣ --- Concepts ---
# Bit Manipulation
# Memory (Stack vs. Heap)
# Recursion
# Dynamic Programming
# Big-O Time & Space
